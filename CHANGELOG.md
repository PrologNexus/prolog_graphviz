# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.5 (2021-03-22)

This release brings the following improvements/simplifications based
on its use of the latest version of the Prolog library Collection:

- Simplify the DOT implementation by reusing the generic
  `ascii_id/[1,2]` predicates from the Prolog Library Collection.

- Apply the Prolog types for Media Types, option dictionaries, and
  I/O streams (sync with Prolog Library Collection).

- Updated all examples and tests to use the latest notation.
