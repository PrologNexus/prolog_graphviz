A simple graph export library for SWI-Prolog.

* Installation

  1. Install [[http://www.swipl-prolog.org][SWI-Prolog]].
  2. Install GraphViz:
    + ~$ sudo apt install graphviz~ on Debian-based distro's, e.g., Ubuntu.
    + ~$ sudo dnf install graphviz~ on Red Hat-based distro's, e.g., Fedora.
  3. Start SWI-Prolog and install this library through the Prolog
     package manager:
     ~pack_install('git://github.com/wouterbeek/graph_export').~

* Simple usage

Once installed, this library can by imported with the following
command:

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
?- [library(graph/graph_export)].
#+END_SRC

** Exporting a single node

The basic feature of this library is that it allows you to write to a
GraphViz output file or to a GraphViz viewer by simply writing to a
Prolog output stream.  The following example shows how to write a
graph consisting of one node, and open the result in a GraphViz
viewer:

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
?- view_graph([Out]>>format(Out, "x [label=<Hello,<BR/>world!>,shape=diamond];\n", [])).
#+END_SRC

This opens the following image inside a GraphViz-compatible viewer:

[[./example/hello.svg]]

** Exporting a single edge

In this example we write a graph that consists of a single edge:

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
?- export_graph('loves.svg', [Out]>>format(Out, "John -- Mary [label=loves]", [])).
#+END_SRC

This writes the following image to an SVG file.  See the table in
Section [[Output formats]] for a full list of supported output formats.

[[./example/loves.svg]]

* Advanced usage

While you can use this library by directly writing DOT strings to an
output stream, more advanced export tasks often benefit from using the
library's support predicates.  The most important ones are:

  - ~dot_node/[2,3]~ for exporting nodes.
  - ~dot_arc/[3,4]~ for exporitng (directed) arcs.
  - ~dot_edge/[3,4]~ for exporting (undirected) edges.

~dot_arc/4~ and ~dot_edge/4~ take a list of options that are emitted
as GraphViz attributes.  Option ~label(+or([string,list(string)]))~
allows (multi-line) Unicode labels to be emitted using HTML-like
labels (see Section [[HTML-like labels]]).

** Exporting a proof tree

Suppose your program returns proof trees that consist of an entailment
rule label, a conclusion, and an arbitrary number of premises:

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
?- Proof = t(rdfs(3),isa(class,class),[t(axiom(rdfs),range(range,class),[]),
                                       t(axiom(rdfs),range(subClassOf,class),[])]).
#+END_SRC

The following program exports such proof trees.  Notice that this
program uses the support predicates.  This allows the nodes to be
characterized by Prolog terms instead of DOT IDs.  For most programs
this results in simplified code because.  Since these support
predicates are idempotent, emitting the same node/edge multiple times
does not accidentally change the exported graph.

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
:- use_module(library(apply)).
:- use_module(library(graph/graph_export)).
:- use_module(library(yall)).

view_proof(Proof) :-
  view_graph({Proof}/[Out]>>export_proof(Out, Proof), [directed(true)]).

export_proof(Out, Tree) :-
  Tree = t(Rule,Concl,Prems),
  dot_node(Out, Concl),
  dot_node(Out, Tree, [color(green),label(Rule)]),
  dot_arc(Out, Concl, Tree),
  maplist(export_subproof(Out, Tree), Prems).

export_subproof(Out, Node, Tree) :-
  Tree = t(_Rule,Concl,_Prems),
  dot_node(Out, Concl),
  dot_arc(Out, Node, Concl),
  export_proof(Out, Tree).
#+END_SRC

Since we use the predicate ~dot_arc/3~, we must specify option
~directed(true)~ (graphs are undirected by default).

In order to open a specific proof tree, like ~$Proof~, in a
GraphViz-compatible viewer, we make the following call:

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
?- view_proof($Proof).
#+END_SRC

This produces the following visualization:

[[./example/proof_tree.svg]]

** Exporting parse trees

Suppose your program returns syntactic parse trees like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
?- Tree = s(np(det(the),n(cat)),vp(v(loves),np(det(the),n(dog))))
#+END_SRC

The following code exports such parse trees to SVG (see
~example/parse_tree.pl~):

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
:- use_module(library(apply)).
:- use_module(library(graph/graph_export)).
:- use_module(library(yall)).

export_tree(Tree) :-
  export_graph('parse_tree.svg', {Tree}/[Out]>>export_tree(Out, Tree, _)).

export_tree(Out, Tree, Id) :-
  Tree =.. [Op|Trees],
  dot_id(Id),
  dot_node_id(Out, Id, [label(Op)]),
  maplist(export_tree(Out), Trees, Ids),
  maplist(dot_edge_id(Out, Id), Ids).
#+END_SRC

Notice that in the above program we use ~dot_node_id/3~ instead of
~dot_node/3~ and ~dot_edge_id/3~ instead of ~dot_edge/3~.  The ~*_id~
versions require us to supply the DOT IDs ourselves.  Arbitrary DOT
IDs are generated with ~dot_id/1~.

We can generate the visualization for the above syntax tree (~$Tree~),
by making the following call:

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
?- export_tree($Tree).
#+END_SRC

This prodices the following result:

[[./example/parse_tree.svg]]

Notice that we create a new DOT ID (~dot_id/1~) for each node in the
tree.  Because of this, the two occurrences of ‘the’ can be
distinguished.

* Directed arcs or undirected edges?

Both directed and undirected graphs can be exported.  By default,
~export_graph/[2,3]~ and ~view_graph/[1,2]~ export undirected graphs.
Directed graphs are exported by setting the ~directed(true)~ option in
~export_graph/3~ or ~view_graph/2~.  For undirected graphs, undirected
edges are emitted with ~dot_edge/[3,4]~ and ~dot_edge_id/[3,4]~.  For
directed graph, directed edges or arcs are emitted with
~dot_arc/[3,4]~ and ~dot_arc_id/[3,4]~.

* Debugging graph exports

Sometimes when you use this library, or any other graph export
library, a graph export may come out incorrectly: it either does not
compile, or it does compile but looks weird.  In such cases, it is
convenient to be able to print the content that is exported to the
top-level for inspection by the programmer.  Printing the export to
the top-level can be enabled with ~debug(dot)~, and disabled by
~nodebug(dot)~ (see library debug for more information).

This section gives a full enumeration of the values that are supported
by this library's options.

* HTML-like labels

The DOT language supports several HTML-like facilities that allow rich
labels to be printed for arcs, edges, and nodes.  These can be
specified by option ~label(+or([string,list(string)]))~, which takes
either a string or a list of strings.  In a list of strings, each
string represents one line in a multi-line label.

Strings must adhere to the following BNF grammar for DOT HTML-like
labels:

#+BEGIN_SRC bnf
label :   text
        | table
text :   textitem
       | text textitem
textitem :   string
           | <BR/>
           | <FONT> text </FONT>
           | <I> text </I>
           | <B> text </B>
           | <U> text </U>
           | <O> text </O>
           | <SUB> text </SUB>
           | <SUP> text </SUP>
           | <S> text </S>
table : [ <FONT> ] <TABLE> rows </TABLE> [ </FONT> ]
rows :   row
       | rows row
       | rows <HR/> row
row: <TR> cells </TR>
cells :   cell
        | cells cell
        | cells <VR/> cell
cell:   <TD> label </TD>
      | <TD> <IMG/> </TD>
#+END_SRC

In addition to the above BNF grammar, tags are allowed to have
attributes that are formatted similar to HTML attributes.  Different
tags support different sets of attributes:

** Supported attributes for ~TABLE~

  - ~ALIGN="CENTER|LEFT|RIGHT"~
  - ~BGCOLOR="color"~
  - ~BORDER="value"~
  - ~CELLBORDER="value"~
  - ~CELLPADDING="value"~
  - ~CELLSPACING="value"~
  - ~COLOR="color"~
  - ~COLUMNS="value"~
  - ~FIXEDSIZE="FALSE|TRUE"~
  - ~GRADIENTANGLE="value"~
  - ~HEIGHT="value"~
  - ~HREF="value"~
  - ~ID="value"~
  - ~PORT="portName"~
  - ~ROWS="value"~
  - ~SIDES="value"~
  - ~STYLE="value"~
  - ~TARGET="value"~
  - ~TITLE="value"~
  - ~TOOLTIP="value"~
  - ~VALIGN="MIDDLE|BOTTOM|TOP"~
  - ~WIDTH="value"~

** Supported attributes for ~BR~

  - ~ALIGN="CENTER|LEFT|RIGHT"~

** Supported attributes for ~FONT~

  - ~COLOR="color"~

    Sets the color of the font of text that appears within
    ~<FONT>…</FONT>~, or the border color of the table or cell within
    the scope of ~<TABLE>…</TABLE>~, or ~<TD>…</TD>~.  This color can
    be overridden by ~COLOR~ attributes in descendents.  By default,
    the font color is determined by the GraphViz ~fontcolor~ attribute
    of the corresponding node, edge or graph, and the border color is
    determined by the GraphViz ~color~ attribute of the corresponding
    node, edge or graph.

  - ~FACE="fontname"~

  - ~POINT-SIZE="value"~

** Supported attributes for ~IMG~

  - ~SCALE="FALSE|TRUE|WIDTH|HEIGHT|BOTH"~
  - ~SRC="value"~

** Supported attributes for ~TD~

  - ~ALIGN="CENTER|LEFT|RIGHT|TEXT"~
  - ~BALIGN="CENTER|LEFT|RIGHT"~
  - ~BGCOLOR="color"~
  - ~BORDER="value"~
  - ~CELLPADDING="value"~
  - ~CELLSPACING="value"~
  - ~COLOR="color"~
  - ~COLSPAN="value"~
  - ~FIXEDSIZE="FALSE|TRUE"~
  - ~GRADIENTANGLE="value"~
  - ~HEIGHT="value"~
  - ~HREF="value"~
